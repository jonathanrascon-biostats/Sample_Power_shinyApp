# Sample_Power_shinyApp
First app: shows relationships between, cohen's d, power level and sample size

The app specifically runs the pwr.t.test function from the pwr package; at significance level .05, two sample and two-sided. Input is a range of power levels and cohen's d levels and outputs a graph of those relations.

Things to add: argument for significance level. I'd like people to be able to choose diff values for alpha and see how that changes to sample~power graphs.
